	<dt><strong>"Pit Bulls have locking jaws."</strong></dt>
	  <dd>The jaws of the Pit Bull are functionally 
          the same as the jaws of any other breed, and this has been proven via 
          expert examination.
      </dd><br>
	<dt><strong>“Pit Bulls don’t feel pain.”</strong></dt>
	  <dd>Pit Bulls have the same nervous system of 
          any other breed, and they can and do feel pain.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>“Pit Bulls have more bite pressure per square inch (PSI) than any 
                 other breed.”</strong></dt>
	  <dd>This is not true. Test have found that other dog breeds, such as the German
          Shepard and Rottweiler, have a higher bite pressure PSI.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>“Pit Bulls ‘turn’ on their owners.”</strong></dt>
	  <dd>Dogs in general do not exhibit behavior "just because". Behaviors are brought on
	      for a reason. Some possible reasons for aggression are improper handling, 
		  lack of socialization, misreading the dog, and disease.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>"Pit Bulls cannot get along with other animals"</strong></dt>
	  <dd>With proper socialization and handling, Pit Bulls can get along well with other animals.
	      Supervision is still a good idea when introducing new animals.</dd><br>
