 <h2>History</h2>
  <p>The history of Pit Bulls varies depending on the sources you refer too. Most advocates to agree that they are decendents of bull-baiting and dog-fighting dogs.
     People immigrating to the U.S. brought their dogs with them in the 1700s through the 1800s. These dogs shared the work, by working as catch and farm dogs 
     to drive semi-wild cattle and hogs and hauling carts for miners. In early America bull-baiting and dog-fighting was still a sport. Working men would match their dogs
     in the pits and gamble on them. Ratting is a sport that emerged around this time. This involved placing a number of rats in a pit with a dog for a specified period of time.
	 The larger the number of rats killed, the higher the dog placed. These dogs went by several names and became todayâ€™s American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, 
     and American Bulldog.            
  </p>
 <h2>Breed Overview</h2>
  <p>Many people believe the term "Pit Bull" refers to a single breed of dog. "Pit Bull" is actually a common name for a type of dog, much like "Hound".
     Some of the common breeds of this dog type are the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and American Bulldog.
	 Pit Bulls can range from medium size (35-65lbs) to large size (100+lbs), depending on the breed.
  </p>
 <h2>Characteristics</h2>
  <p>Pit Bulls are solid, powerful, energetic dogs. They have a square head, with a broad, medium length muzzle. Their coat is short, glossy, smooth, and comes in various colors.
     Pit Bulls are strong, confident, determined, and loyal. These qualities make them excellent companions, but can also make them difficult to work with.
  </p>
 <h2>Training</h2>
  <p>Pits respond very well to training. They are eager to please and are usually learn quick. Sometimes they are stubborn and like to test you though. Training is highly recommended
     for these dogs. A well trained Pit Bull can serve as an advocate for Pits, everyone likes a dog who listens, and if you want to take your Pit Bull places good behavior is essential.
	 There are many different traing options for Pits. They excel at obedience, agility, and weight pulling competitions.	 
  </p>
 <h2>Temperament</h2>
  <p>In my experience and research, Pits crave human attention, and have so much love to offer in return. Each dog is different, but slow introductions to other animals is a good idea.
     Pits do exhibit aggression towards other animals sometimes. Human aggression is not a problem specific to Pit Bulls.Like any other breeds, mishandled, abused, and unsocialized Pits
     can result in inappropriate aggression. Socialization is very important for these dogs. Temperament testing of Pit Bulls by the American Temperament Test Society show Pit Bulls testing
	 very well, even testing better than other popular dog breeds. Pit Bulls are very powerful and they can inflict a lot of damage in a very short amount of 
     time. Good training, structure, and socialization can reduce the likihood of any inappropriate aggression and help them to be excellent companions.
