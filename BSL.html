 <p>Pit Bulls have been unfairly discriminated against since the 1980’s when illegal dog fighting made a big come back.
    Stories of dog fighting were often in the news showing and telling some of the most viscous details of these fights.
	As if this didn’t make Pit Bulls feared enough, there were also several reports of these dogs getting loose and attacking innocent people.
	These stories reported on the worst aspects of these dogs and generalized it for all Pit Bulls. This generalization was unfair because the
	dogs in these reports were often neglected, abused, or trained for fighting. The vast amount of negative media attention surrounding Pit Bulls 
	has instilled a fear of these animals in many Americans across the nation. This fear has caused hundreds of cities to invoke breed specific legislation (BSL)
	banning Pit Bulls, or putting unjust restrictions on them.
 </p>
 <p>According to the American Dog Breeders Association, breed specific laws do not work. They gave an example of a task force formed in 2003 to study the effectiveness
    of a Pit Bull ban in Prince George County, Maryland. This task force reported from their findings that the county spends around a quarter of a million dollars a year 
	enforcing the law and the “public safety hadn’t improved as a result of the ban.” The Dog Breeders Association goes on to say that they believe what will make communities 
	safer is “ dog license laws, leash laws, animal fighting laws, and laws that require all dog owners to control their dogs, regardless of breed” (Why Doesn’t BSL Work).
 </p>
 <p>BSL bans seem to do more harm than good. These bans force families to relocate or give up their Pit(s). Animal shelters fill up with these dogs and the bans make it difficult 
    to adopt them out. According to Pam D’Addio with the Examiner, an estimated one million Pit Bulls are euthanized each year. That’s roughly twenty eight hundred Pits a day. 
	She also reports that only one in six hundred Pit Bulls find a forever home (Pit Bulls and Euthanasia Rates). City bans on Pits also keep them from being allowed at dog parks 
	and doggy day care. These places help them get the socialization that they desperately need, so that they learn to be friendly to people and other animals.
 </p>
 <p>Some people believe that Pits who have been used for fighting, are aggressive, or have experienced a lot of abuse and trauma, can never be good dogs and need to be put down. 
    This is not always true. Take Michael Vick’s dogs for example. There are many stories of the dogs he used for fighting that have been rehabilitated and adopted out to good homes. 
	You can also find tons of stories about Pit Bulls that have had horrible lives, but now are wonderful pets, on Pit Bull rescue websites.
