  <h2>Breed-Spcific Health Problems</h2>
    <dl>
	<dt><strong>Aortic Stenosis</strong></dt>
	  <dd>Aortic Stenosis is a condition in which the aortic valve is abnormally narrowing
	      in varying degrees. Dogs with mild Aortic Stenosis will have a normal life expectancy
		  and won't need special treatment. In moderate cases the heart muscle becomes thicker
		  as it works harder to push the blood through the valve. Your dog may start to tire more 
		  easily. As the condition worsens your dog may have trouble breathing and develop a cough.
		  A veterinarian may prescribe medication to help. It is also recommended that you restrict 
		  your dog's exercise.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Ataxia</strong></dt>
	  <dd>Ataxia is a neurological disease that seems to appear between 3 and 5 years of age. Symptoms 
	      of Ataxia are unsteady feet, stumbling or falling, especially when turning, tremors when 
		  concentrating, and lifting feet abnormally high when walking. A mostly normal life is possible,
		  but this is a progressive disease and will get worse over time.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Cancer</strong></dt>
	  <dd>Cancer is a major killer of Pit Bulls, as it is with many breeds. Some of the common cancers found
	      in Pit Bulls are Hemangiosarcoma (cancer of the blood vessels), Lymphosarcoma (cancer of the lymph nodes),
		  and mast cell tumors (skin cancer).</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Crucial Ligament Injuries</strong></dt>
	  <dd>A knee problem commonly seen in athletic dogs is injury to the anterior, or cranial, cruciate ligament.
	      The cruciate ligament helps to hold the knee in place. A sudden change in direction can cause ligament tear.
		  Surgery can correct the problem, but arthritis is likely to develop with age.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Hip or Elbow Dysplasia</strong></dt>
	  <dd>Elbow dysplasia is basically arthritis of the elbow, and can be treated with surgery. Hip dysplasia
	      is when the head of the femur doesn't fit properly into the socket of the hip joint. This can cause it 
		  to come out of the socket altogether. Even if the bone doesn't fully come out, the loose fit can cause swelling.
          Mild cases, symptoms can be treated, but there is no cure other than surgery to replace part of the hip joint.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong></dt>
	  <dd>Hypothyroidism is caused by inflammation or shrinking of the thyroid gland. A dog with this condition may
	      lose his fur, or the fur may become thin. It will become dull and the there may be scaly skin. Weight gain, loss of
		  desire to excerise, and ear infections are possible. Hypothyroidism is treatable with medications prescribed by a
		  veterinarian.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Luxating Patella</strong></dt>
	  <dd>Pit Bulls tend to be more susceptible to skin allergies than other breeds. These allergies can be caused by parasites,
	      plants, or food. Figuring out what your dog is allegic too is not easy. In mild cases of food allergies, a simple change
		  in food may solve the problem. In severe cases of food allergies a vetrinarian may put your dog on a one-ingredient diet, 
		  and add foods until a balanced diet without allergic reactions is found.</dd><br>
